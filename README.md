## Background

LIN28A is an RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and stem cell differentiation. It has also been implicated in various types of cancer, where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis by regulating key signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Despite its importance in cancer biology, the molecular mechanisms underlying LIN28A function in cancer progression are not well understood.
