LIN28A Is a Suppressor of ER-Associated Translation in Embryonic Stem Cells (article) Author Cho, Jun and Chang, Hyeshik and Kwon, S.

Narry Journal Cell Year 2012 [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.10.019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.10.019)

### Background

LIN28A is an RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and stem cell differentiation. It has also been implicated in various types of cancer, where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis by regulating key signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Despite its importance in cancer biology, the molecular mechanisms underlying LIN28A function in cancer progression are not well understood.

### Objectives

1. Differential gene expression analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed between cancer patients with high vs low LIN28A expression levels
2. Identify pathways that are enriched among differentially expressed genes
3. Construct and analyse a protein-protein interaction network based on LIN28A CLIP-seq data
4. Predict which genes or proteins are regulated by LIN28A in cancer cells
